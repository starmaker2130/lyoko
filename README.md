white paper (inform 7)

"Many features of natural language are readily imitated in conventional code: a verb
juxtaposing nouns is a procedure call with its arguments,7
 an adjective is a function which
returns true or false, a proper noun (“Mr Jones”) is a constant (or an object), a common
noun (“man”) is a data type (or a class), prepositional phrases (“Jack is in the box”) could
be regarded as tests of standard data structures such as trees, and so on. But Inform is
considerably strengthened by two aspects of natural language less easily visible in orthodox
programming: tenses and determiners.
If our aim is minimise the number of named variables, it is worth nothing that many
variables in IF are essentially counters or flags, that is, totals or ways to remember past
states of play: whether something has happened or not. In natural language, we can simply
say “if the black door has been open” or “the number of things on the table”, avoiding the
need for flag or count variables, with their names to be remembered, and the possibility
of error in initialising them"
(page 11)

"Inform does not aspire to recognise anything like the whole sweep of natural language,
and in a few cases usefulness has been allowed to trump linguistic fidelity: in particular, it
does not attempt to reject all un-natural language. But on the whole Inform tries to avoid
eccentricity. The four self-imposed guidelines for the language were as follows:
1. A casual reader should easily be able to guess what a sentence does, and that guess
should be correct.
2. The language should be economical, but not to the point where this compromises
its intelligibility.
3. If in doubt as to syntax, imitate books or newspapers.
4. Contextual knowledge is best supplied by the author, rather than being built in."
(page 13)

"A system of gradations of rules has two prerequisites. First, the compiler needs a solid
understanding of types: in particular, a way to judge whether one category (“an open
container”) is a special case of another (“a container”). Secondly, the author needs a flexible
way to describe the circumstances in which rules are to apply. Both considerations mesh
well with the use of natural language: to make sense of the ambiguities of English, a strong
typing system is needed anyway; and natural language is good at describing circumstances
(“in the presence of Mrs Dalloway”) and categories (“a woman in a lighted room”)."
(page 18)

"A more measured answer given by Davis and Gillon (2004) is that semantics is concerned
with two basic questions:
What values are to be associated with the basic expressions of a language? How does
the meaning of the simpler expressions contribute to the meaning of the complex
expressions the simpler ones make up?" (page 19)
