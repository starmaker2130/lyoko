white paper (inform 7)

"Many features of natural language are readily imitated in conventional code: a verb
juxtaposing nouns is a procedure call with its arguments,7
 an adjective is a function which
returns true or false, a proper noun (“Mr Jones”) is a constant (or an object), a common
noun (“man”) is a data type (or a class), prepositional phrases (“Jack is in the box”) could
be regarded as tests of standard data structures such as trees, and so on. But Inform is
considerably strengthened by two aspects of natural language less easily visible in orthodox
programming: tenses and determiners.
If our aim is minimise the number of named variables, it is worth nothing that many
variables in IF are essentially counters or flags, that is, totals or ways to remember past
states of play: whether something has happened or not. In natural language, we can simply
say “if the black door has been open” or “the number of things on the table”, avoiding the
need for flag or count variables, with their names to be remembered, and the possibility
of error in initialising them"
